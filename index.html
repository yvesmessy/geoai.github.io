	QGS stands for Quantum Geopolitical Strategies, it’s a symbol of the philosophy we employ in our information product. Capital markets are in for dozens more Brexit-type events over coming months, the savviest investors will do their utmost to understand, expect, assess, and adjust their portfolio to avoid politics and geopolitics-related shocks to portfolio asset values.

	Though we understand that there are hundreds of thousands of experts with the expertise to provide world class advice on this subject matter, we feel confident that the full force of data available openly, when combined with intelligent approaches, will help investors get heads up and exposure data at the very lowest possible expense, in the most custom-tailored way.
